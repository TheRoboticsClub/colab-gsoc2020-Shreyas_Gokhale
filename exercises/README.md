## Python Environment
To easily get all the dependencies and set up a virtual environment, execute following instructions.

```shell script
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 venv 
source venv/bin/activate
pip install  -r requirements.txt
```

This creates virtual environment at `./venv/` using python 2, activates it, and installs the requirements recursively.
Activate venv every time when you want to execute the solution.
